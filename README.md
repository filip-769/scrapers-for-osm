# Scrapers for OpenStreetMap

A project inspired by https://github.com/alltheplaces/alltheplaces focused on Slovakia.

## Generating output geojsons

Make sure you have the latest version of Deno installed and run `deno run -A your_scraper/main.js`. The file is located at `your_scraper/output.geojson`.

## License

The code to generate the output is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.
I do not claim any copyright over the output it generates.
It should be OK to use this data for contributing to OSM (I recommend reading https://github.com/alltheplaces/alltheplaces/issues?q=is%3Aissue+license).
